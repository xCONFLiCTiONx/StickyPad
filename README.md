Just a simple form of Windows 10 Sticky Notes without the annoying stuff like being an open window in the taskbar and popups.

I wanted a sticky pad that was just for text and no links but more importantly, I hated seeing that icon as an open window in the taskbar.

- You can still have the icon in the taskbar and it will open the window but doesn't show as an active window

- if StickyPad is alreay open then it will bring it to the front.

- It does not sync and is not encrypted or anything. Just a simple StickyPad. Settings and text is stored in "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\xCONFLiCTiONx\StickyPad" 

- The text saves as soon as you move your mouse cursor off the StickyPad so that it isn't lost if Windows crashes or something, and also saves when closing.

- The second tab is there if you want to hide tab 1 when others enter the room or if you want to store links that you don't want to view on tab 1 or whatever you like.


# Installation

- Copy the files to a location of your choice such as "%ProgramFiles%\StickyPad"

- Create a shortcut to StickyPad.exe (right click > Send to > Desktop (create shortcut))

Optional (recommended)

Copy the shortcut that is on the desktop to:

- "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"

- "%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"

- Pin the shortcut to the taskbar

- delete the shortcut on the desktop
